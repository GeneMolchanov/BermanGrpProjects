<strong><span style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; color:#060D36;">NYC Required Notice - Lead Paint, Window Guard, Fire Safety Annual Certification </span></strong><br />
      <span style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; text-align:justify"><br />
      </span><span style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; text-align:justify">
Landlords in multiple dwellings (buildings with 3 or more apartments) are legally required to send a notice to tenants or occupants every year to inquire about the ages of children living in the building. The notice contains a form that tenants must return. The notice also contains information about window guards and peeling lead paint.
<br/><br/>

<!-- questions -->

<!--1-->
<em><strong>Where can landlords find the annual notice?</strong></em><br/>

<!-- end 1-->


<br/><br/>

<!--2-->
<em><strong>When should the annual notice be sent to tenants?</strong></em><br/>
Landlords are required to send the annual notice to tenants no earlier than January 1 and no later than than January 15 each year. 
<br/><br/>
The notice may be delivered to tenants by:
<br/>
1. First Class mail, addressed to the occupant of the dwelling unit.<br/>
2. Hand delivery to the occupant of the dwelling unit, or<br/>
3. Enclosure with the January rent bill, if such rent bill is delivered after December 15th but no later than January 16th. 
<br/><br/>

<!--3-->
<em><strong>What if the tenant/occupant does not return the form?</strong></em><br/>
If the landlord does not receive the completed form by February 15th, the landlord must inspect the occupant’s apartment, giving reasonable notice and at reasonable times, to determine if a child of applicable age lives in the apartment. If there is a child 10 years or younger living in the apartment, the landlord must inspect the apartment to determine if window guards are installed and are in good repair. If between February 16th and March 1st, the landlord has made reasonable attempts but has been unable to gain access to the apartment, the landlord must notify DOHMH.
<br /><br/>
<!-- end 3-->

<em><strong>What if the tenant/occupant does not return the form?</strong></em><br/>

<br /><br/>
<!-- end 4-->

<!--5-->
