<hr align="left" size="1" noshade>
<span class="ltext">NPCR is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization working to revitalize New York&#39;s low- and moderate-income neighborhoods and communities of color that are disproportionately impacted by brownfield sites. <a href="http://www.npcr.net/">NPCR</a> is widely recognized as being instrumental in the conceptualization and creation of New York&#39;s area-wide Brownfield Opportunity Areas program. Since 2003, when the NYS Brownfields Law was passed, NPCR has worked to secure resources for communities participating in the BOA program, including $32.4 million awarded by NYS to 110 communities; and to strengthen government policies for the implementation of area-wide strategies. NPCR is active on local, state and national brownfield policy issues.

<br><br>
Keep your eye on the Governor’s 2014/15 proposed state budget which is scheduled to be released in mid January, as there are several reasons to be optimistic that we will see a brownfields reform package.  First, Gov. Cuomo’s decision to include new funding for Brownfield Opportunity Area (BOA) projects in last year’s budget enabled the creation and advancement of economic revitalization strategies in 26 communities. In the Governor’s press release about the $10 million appropriation, NPCR Executive Director Jody Kass said: “Gov. Cuomo’s announcement is very good news for communities across the state that will have new tools and resources to join over 100 neighborhoods already active in the BOA program.” http://www.governor.ny.gov/press/10172013-brownfields-grants. With next year’s fiscal plan currently under development, NPCR is urging the Governor to include $15 million in new BOA money in his budget proposal. The pent-up demand from communities across the state to participate in BOA and the historic support this program has had among state lawmakers are strong drivers for growing the BOA program when the Legislature votes on the 2014-2015 budget later this spring.</span><br><br>

<p><span class="titleG">6th Annual NYC Brownfields Forum Set for Downtown Brooklyn</span><br>
  <br>
  <span class="text2">With the future of New York State’s brownfield programs to be determined in the next few months, NPCR’s 6th Annual Brownfields Forum is shaping up as not-to-be-missed event. Hosted by National Grid at their Headquarters in Downtown Brooklyn on Thursday, January 30th, panel sessions will cover:
  <br /><br />
  <ul>
<li>Brownfield Financial Incentives/Brownfield Tax Credits </li>
<li>Brownfields & the new Mayor of New York City</li>
<li>Sandy Recovery & the Brownfield Opportunity Areas (BOA) Program</li>
<li>NPCR’s 2014 Green Shovel Awards</li>
</ul>
Coming so close to Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s State of the State address and release of his proposed 2014-15 budget, the Forum will likely be the first public dialogue on brownfields in the context of a new political dynamic in the Albany landscape.

<img src="http://placehold.it/375x150"><br/>
Robert Schick, P.E., Director of the Division of Environmental Remediation at the NYS Department of Environmental Conservation, Daniel Walsh, director of the New York City Office of Environmental Remediation, and Dale Desnoyers, of Allen & Desnoyers, discuss state brownfield issues at NPCR Roundtable.

   <div class="text2" style="text-align:center"><strong>IMPROVING SENIOR SUPPORTIVE HOUSING IN THE BRONX</strong></div><br />
<span class="text2">
In connection with its mission to provide safe, affordable, supportive housing, West Side Federation for Senior and Supportive Housing (WSFSSH) acquired Borinquen Court, a senior supportive housing facility located at 285 East 138th Street in the Bronx, New York in February 2011. The property was part of the South Bronx Neighborhood Development Area, an urban renewal area created by New York City through eminent domain proceedings in the mid 1970s. The original sponsor of the project, the South Bronx Housing Corporation, constructed the building and obtained a Certificate of Occupancy on July 9, 1981. In February of 2011, HUD transferred ownership of the building to an affiliate of WSFSSH, the East One Thirty Eighth Housing Development Fund Company, Inc. (East 138th HDFC, Inc.). The property is currently part of the Port Morris Harlem RIverfront Brownfield Opportunity Area (BOA).
<br /><br />
While doing its due diligence on the property, WSFSSH learned that for 40 years the property had been the location of a gas station with five underground storage tanks (USTs); and that other historical uses included an auto repair shop, a parking garage with at least two gasoline USTs and a mattress factory. After attending one of NPCR&#39;s brownfield workshops, WSFSSH requested technical assistance, through NPCR&#39;s START-UP program, to manage the environmental conditions at the site. NPCR reviewed the available environmental information to ascertain the extent of the problem, developed several remedial scenarios and associated cost estimates to help WSFSSH understand the potential risks involved in acquiring the property and then discussed the options for various regulatory programs with WSFSSH.

<span class="ltext">
    For more than a decade, Peter Walsh led the Department of State team responsible for guiding implementation of New York’s Brownfield Opportunity Areas (BOA) program. In December, Peter announced his retirement from state service. His colleagues, friends and the BOA community at large will miss his thoughtful, creative, steady leadership. With Peter leading the way, New York’s BOA program grew to involve over 125 communities and invested some $48 million in revitalization strategies for neighborhoods across the state.  At a reception on his final day, NPCR joined with others recognizing Peter’s great accomplishments, and thanking him for his years of service to New York’s communities.<br>
