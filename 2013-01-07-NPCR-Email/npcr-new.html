   <span class="ltext"><br />We have high expectations that 2014 will be the year Gov. Andrew Cuomo leads New York to new levels of success in solving the state's brownfields problems. We'll know more after hearing his State of the State address and learning what's in his proposed budget. You can read about the historic coalition that came together in late 2013 on a reform package in this newsletter. 
We also want to spotlight some key 2013 accomplishments. High on the list was the Governor's October 17th announcement awarding crucial neighborhood revitalization resources to 26 communities under the BOA program. New York has now invested more than $48 million through the Brownfield Opportunity Areas (BOA) program, benefitting more than 125 participating communities.

   <span class="title">MEMBER HIGHLIGHT<br>
   </span><br />
<span class="ltext"><em>NPCR's Board of Directors and membership is made up of professionals who all have some relationship to the nuts and bolts of community revitalization. Their specialized expertise adds to NPCR's depth and leadership on the range of brownfield issues, perhaps none more complex than those relating to environmental remediation.  Now, one of our members, Benjamin Alter, Senior Vice President at GZA GeoEnvironmental, Inc. is sharing his expertise in a new book, <u>Environmental Consulting Fundamentals</u>, that offers guidance to young environmental scientists and engineers who are contemplating a career in environmental consulting, particularly in the area of remediation.</em>
<br /><br />

Benjamin Alter, who has worked as an environmental consultant himself for over 20 years, also teaches a graduate course in environmental consulting at Hunter College. In the absence of a sufficiently comprehensive textbook, he developed his own course materials, which ultimately led to the completion of this information-packed text. Acknowledging that each topic he covers could justify a book in itself, and being clear that the text must be supplemented with actual field experience, Alter covers many, if not most, of the kinds of environmental issues a consultant most commonly faces, from environmental impact analysis, to water sampling, lead abatement, and much more. But the primary emphasis -- and the greatest detail -- is given to the topics of the investigation and remediation of contamination.  He starts with geology and chemistry basics, and then takes the reader through the process of finding, assessing and addressing contamination, both in the environment and in indoor spaces. He places his guidance in the context of the various regulatory frameworks, but emphasizes the thought process that makes a consultant's involvement so valuable to the client, whether public or private.
<br/>
<br/>
Alter's passion for both his subject matter and his role as a teacher is apparent on every page.  He has created a unique guide that offers students and young professionals alike a good understanding of what environmental consulting is all about, as well as a resource that will help ready an apprentice consultant for the challenges of the profession.
<br/>
<em><br/>
Environmental Consulting Fundamentals: Investigation and Remediation</em>, by Benjamin Alter, was published in 2012 by CRC Press, an imprint of the Taylor & Francis Group, Boca Raton, London, and New York.

    <span class="ltext"><em>Founded in 2001, NPCR is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization dedicated to the revitalization of low- and moderate-income neighborhoods and communities of color that are disproportionately impacted by brownfield sites. NPCR is widely recognized as being instrumental in the conceptualization and creation of New York State's Brownfield Opportunity Areas (BOA) program. To date, NPCR has helped secure $46 million in BOA grants for over 125 communities across New York State to conduct pre-development planning and feasibility studies, and to get sites shovel ready for re-use.

<span class="titleG">ALBANY REPORT</span><span class="text2"><br><br>
Keep your eye on the Governor's 2014/15 proposed state budget which is scheduled to be released in mid January, as there are several reasons to be optimistic that we will see a brownfields reform package.  First, Gov. Cuomo's decision to include new funding for Brownfield Opportunity Area (BOA) projects in last year's budget enabled the creation and advancement of economic revitalization strategies in 26 communities. In the Governor's press release about the $10 million appropriation, NPCR Executive Director Jody Kass said: &quot;Gov. Cuomo's announcement is very good news for communities across the state that will have new tools and resources to join over 100 neighborhoods already active in the BOA program.&quot; http://www.governor.ny.gov/press/10172013-brownfields-grants. With next year's fiscal plan currently under development, NPCR is urging the Governor to include $15 million in new BOA money in his budget proposal. The pent-up demand from communities across the state to participate in BOA and the historic support this program has had among state lawmakers are strong drivers for growing the BOA program when the Legislature votes on the 2014-2015 budget later this spring.

<br/><br/>

The other big brownfield issue in 2014 is the future of the Brownfield Cleanup Program (BCP) and controversial tax credits (BTCs) associated with the BCP.  With the BTCs scheduled to sunset December 31, 2015, pressure is growing for the state to act.   An historic Coalition has come together around a package of policy reforms outlined in a joint letter that was sent to the Governor in late December. {http://npcr.net/pages/legislation_and_policy/nys_initiatives.html}  Recognizing that there is widespread support for some form of brownfield tax credits, while at the same time acknowledging that the program needs reform, NPCR worked with environmental justice and other environmental allies along with representatives of the business and development communities to develop a win-win solution. Building on NPCR's spring Roundtables and May 2013 report, Reform on the Horizon, http://npcr.net/pages/legislation_and_policy/docs/Report-ReformontheHorizon.pdf, the proposed package of policy reforms calls for continuation of the BTCs for 10 years coupled with reforms to make sure the credits are used in communities and for projects that need them. The joint letter also calls for an increase in the BOA BTC bonus, from the current 2% to 10%. In addition to NPCR, organizations that signed the letter include the NYS Business Council, REBNY, the New York City Environmental Justice Alliance, Environmental Advocates, Environmental Defense Fund, and the New York League of Conservation Voters.   The letter also reflected unprecedented support for the BOA program, stating: &quot;We recognize the importance of the BOA program as a tool to create value and generate economic development,&quot; and agrees that &quot;BOA deserves additional support, especially now that hundreds of development sites are emerging from the State's BOA investment.&quot;
<br>
<br>
NPCR's complete New York State policy agenda, including support for new funding for the Environmental Restoration Program (ERP) and the BOA Enhancement bill (S.1678 Grisanti) is available on the web at: http://npcr.net/pages/legislation_and_policy.html. </span><br>

<p><span class="titleG">6th Annual NYC Brownfields Forum Set for Downtown Brooklyn</span><br>
  <br>
   <span class="text2">With the future of New York State's brownfield programs to be determined in the next few months, NPCR's 6th Annual Brownfields Forum is shaping up as not-to-be-missed event. Hosted by National Grid at their Headquarters in Downtown Brooklyn on Thursday, January 30th, panel sessions will cover:</span>
  <br /><br />
  <ul>
<li>Brownfield Financial Incentives/Brownfield Tax Credits </li>
<li>Brownfields & the new Mayor of New York City</li>
<li>Sandy Recovery & the Brownfield Opportunity Areas (BOA) Program</li>
<li>NPCR's 2014 Green Shovel Awards</li>
</ul>
<span class="text2">Coming so close to Gov. Andrew Cuomo's State of the State address and release of his proposed 2014-15 budget, the Forum will likely be the first public dialogue on brownfields in the context of a new political dynamic in the Albany landscape.
  </span></p>
<p><span class="text2"> NPCR's Forum brings together leaders from the community and economic development arenas, lenders, environmental justice, industrial and affordable housing development, as well as architects, engineers, lawyers, consultants and government agency representatives. In past years, this event has also served as the venue for federal, New York State and City officials and  legislators to come together to discuss key issues emerging on brownfields and community revitalization.  <br/>

Department of Environmental Conservation, Daniel Walsh, director of the New York City Office of Environmental Remediation, and Dale Desnoyers, of Allen & Desnoyers, discuss state brownfield issues at NPCR Roundtable.
<br/><br/>

NPCR held a morning Roundtable that brought together developers with public and private sector experts on brownfield redevelopment matters.  Over 100 people participated in the sold-out event. Topics included: the implications of New York State's sunsetting Brownfield Tax Credits (BTCs); the option and benefits of the City's regulatory and brownfield incentive programs; updates on the pipeline of development projects emerging from New York's  Brownfield Opportunity Area (BOA) communities, with presentations from Cypress Hill and Jamaica, Queens; and highlights of recent developments in the environmental insurance market.  The Roundtable was endorsed by seven Developer organizations including:  Associated Builders and Owners of Greater New York (ABO); Greater New York Construction User Council; International Council of Shopping Centers (ICSC); NAIOP-NYC; New York Housing Conference; NYS Association for Affordable Housing (NYSAFAH); Real Estate Board of New York (REBNY).

For more than a decade, Peter Walsh led the Department of State team responsible for guiding implementation of New York's Brownfield Opportunity Areas (BOA) program. In December, Peter announced his retirement from state service. His colleagues, friends and the BOA community at large will miss his thoughtful, creative, steady leadership. With Peter leading the way, New York's BOA program grew to involve over 125 communities and invested some $48 million in revitalization strategies for neighborhoods across the state.  At a reception on his final day, NPCR joined with others recognizing Peter's great accomplishments, and thanking him for his years of service to New York's communities.<br>
