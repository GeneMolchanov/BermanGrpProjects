	<hr align="left" size="1" noshade>
	<span class="ltext">NPCR is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization working to revitalize New York&#39;s low- and moderate-income neighborhoods and communities of color that are disproportionately impacted by brownfield sites. <a href="http://www.npcr.net/">NPCR</a> is widely recognized as being instrumental in the conceptualization and creation of New York&#39;s area-wide Brownfield Opportunity Areas program. Since 2003, when the NYS Brownfields Law was passed, NPCR has worked to secure resources for communities participating in the BOA program, including $32.4 million awarded by NYS to 110 communities; and to strengthen government policies for the implementation of area-wide strategies. NPCR is active on local, state and national brownfield policy issues.

	<span class="text2">
		Several hundred people gathered for NPCR&#39;s 4th Annual Brownfields Forum, held January 17th in New York City. The event featured the first ever BOA EXPO, including a wide range of participants from community-based organizations, state, local and national government representatives, and development professionals. The evening ended with a reception celebrating NPCR&#39;s 10th Anniversary. The featured keynote speaker was USEPA Assistant Administrator (and NPCR co-founder) Mathy Stanislaus, who said:
		<br><br>
		&quot;We at the Environmental Protection Agency congratulate you on your success in leading the use of the community-led area-wide planning approach to spark brownfields cleanups and neighborhood renewal. I strongly believe that area-wide planning is a key tool to revitalize economically distressed communities and America&#39;s downtowns.  We see New York&#39;s Brownfield Opportunity Areas program as a national model for the type of area-wide strategies that other cities, states, and community-based organizations should consider as they seek to promote public health and economic revitalization in their own cities and towns.&quot; 
		<br><br>
		&quot;Bringing municipal and community leaders together with investors, architects, lawyers and developers who are ready to invest in and help rebuild distressed neighborhoods is a example of how to build for a sustainable future. Area-wide planning enables a locally driven process to align land use planning, market and infrastructure analysis to convert brownfield properties into key anchors to meet critical local community needs such as affordable housing, and local jobs through sustainable manufacturing and green space.&quot;   
		<br><br>
		&quot;You have our full support in your efforts. What we at EPA hope to see coming from the BOA initiative, and from our own 23 area-wide planning pilot grantees and upcoming 2nd round of area-wide planning grants, are ideas and best practices to foster regional economic re-development approaches, especially in ways that help traditionally under-served communities get projects done creating jobs and building sustainable communities.&quot;

	<span class="titleG">POLICY AND PROGRAM<br>DEVELOPMENTS</span><br>
    <br>
    <span class="text2"><em>New BOA Legislation</em> - Senator Mark Grisanti, chair of the Senate Environmental Conservation Committee has just introduced a bill to strengthen the BOA program which NPCR helped draft (S.6316). There are myriad government agencies that have a hand in implementing BOA strategies. The Department of State (DOS) has a long history of working with local government and community partners on a wide range of projects, and has had remarkable success getting agencies out of their &quot;silos.&quot; This bill would statutorily empower the DOS to play a strong coordinating role to help achieve communities&#39; revitalization goals, even as government agencies at all levels are being asked to do more with less. The bill would also strengthen the existing &#39;preference and priority&#39; provision and add more flexibility to the BOA program. 
	<br /><br />
	<em>BOA Budget &amp; Awards</em> - Although Governor Cuomo&#39;s proposed 2012-2013 budget does not include new money for the BOA program, it does re-appropriate funds from previous years needed to keep the program moving forward. Indeed, we hear from the Governor&#39;s office that the Department of State will continue to accept applications to the BOA program in the coming year, and anticipate the next round of BOA awards before the end of the fiscal year. To make this happen, it is important that your Albany leaders hear from you about the importance of the BOA program and a timely award announcement.

    <div class="text2" style="text-align:center"><strong>IMPROVING SENIOR SUPPORTIVE HOUSING IN THE BRONX</strong></div><br />
	<span class="text2">
		In connection with its mission to provide safe, affordable, supportive housing, West Side Federation for Senior and Supportive Housing (WSFSSH) acquired Borinquen Court, a senior supportive housing facility located at 285 East 138th Street in the Bronx, New York in February 2011. The property was part of the South Bronx Neighborhood Development Area, an urban renewal area created by New York City through eminent domain proceedings in the mid 1970s. The original sponsor of the project, the South Bronx Housing Corporation, constructed the building and obtained a Certificate of Occupancy on July 9, 1981. In February of 2011, HUD transferred ownership of the building to an affiliate of WSFSSH, the East One Thirty Eighth Housing Development Fund Company, Inc. (East 138th HDFC, Inc.). The property is currently part of the Port Morris Harlem RIverfront Brownfield Opportunity Area (BOA).
		<br /><br />
		While doing its due diligence on the property, WSFSSH learned that for 40 years the property had been the location of a gas station with five underground storage tanks (USTs); and that other historical uses included an auto repair shop, a parking garage with at least two gasoline USTs and a mattress factory. After attending one of NPCR&#39;s brownfield workshops, WSFSSH requested technical assistance, through NPCR&#39;s START-UP program, to manage the environmental conditions at the site. NPCR reviewed the available environmental information to ascertain the extent of the problem, developed several remedial scenarios and associated cost estimates to help WSFSSH understand the potential risks involved in acquiring the property and then discussed the options for various regulatory programs with WSFSSH.

    <strong><span class="title2">February 16, 2012: </span> <br />
	<span class="ltext"><u>Brownfield Financial Incentives: <br>An NPCR breakfast roundtable<br>and networking opportunity,<br>in NYC </u></strong><br><br>
	<span class="ltext">
     New York needs robust financial incentives to encourage the cleanup and re-use of brownfield sites in its once vibrant downtown and industrial areas. The Brownfield Tax Credits (BTCs), which were capped in 2008 and deferred in 2010, have been maligned as not providing targeted resources in support of communities most in need. Even so, with the pending 2015 sunset of the BTCs, few new projects will be able to secure the requisite regulatory sign-off in time to utilize the BTCs, leaving the state with virtually no site-specific brownfield financial incentives. All participants are encouraged to share their ideas at this Roundtable. Developers, community leaders, environmental justice representatives, legislative and government officials, real estate and environmental lawyers and other community development practitioners will help lead the discussion.<br>
